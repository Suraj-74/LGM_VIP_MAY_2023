In this task , I worked on project Neural Nerwork that can read Handwriting. In this i used tensorflow and keras library for build a neural network model which can read handwriting.<br>
Tensorflow is one of the popular and widely used library to implement deep learning algorithm.<br>
In this project, first I convert the image into a format that can read by neural network then i normalized it.<br>
After that I build a common architecture is a CNN(Convolution Neural Network). It is used for extracting features from the input image.<br>
last, I trained a neural network for predicting a result<br>
